Scripts that are desinged to extract information from the halog end-of-run files and insert this into SQL tables for the purpose of creating runlist (ie easy to get list of runs with certain beam current, energy, VDC HVs etc).



Basic structure of files:

Directories are:


	    log_to_sql: scripts to process through logfiles and fill SQL tables

	    SciFi_runlist: SciFi related scripts

	    plot: scripts that plot from sql tables (or otherwise get results from them)
	    
	    
Important note that log_to_sql contains file Directories.py to read in local directories and also mySQL specific parameters (Database name etc) and must be altered for specific systems.





run_all.py: should go over all runs to fill table APEXrunlist (and linked table HV_Values)




apex_test_add_all.py: contains functions 

		      APEX_get_end:  which returns a query and values for mysql for 
		      		   	 and equivalents of the HVs


			APEX_mysql: which inserts the results from APEX_get_end into the APEXRunlist and HV_Result

					 
		     
SciFi_runlist.py: attempt at script to get all SciFi runs from DB	       




apex_add_good_cosmics.py: script that prints a list of numbers (run numbers) to a csv file (list determined offline, desgined for 'good' scifi cosmics runs)




apex_good_cosmics_table.py: script that takes from csv file created by apex_add_good_cosmics.py and get run parameterts (HV, and latency) from APEXrunlist (and HV table)




add_SciFi_latency.py: script to add SciFi latencies to APEXrunlist



apex-sql-coinc.py & apex-sql-end-coinc.py:
Scripts copied from tritium versions that record info from end and start of run text files
