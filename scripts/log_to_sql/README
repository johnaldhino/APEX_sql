	    - fills in run, target_type, prescale factor and other variables (for mysql table)

		      APEX_get_end:  which returns a query and values for mysql for 
		      		   	 and equivalents of the HVs


			APEX_mysql: which inserts the results from APEX_get_end into the APEXRunlist and HV_Result

					 
		    

apex-sql-coinc.py & apex-sql-end-coinc.py:
Scripts copied from tritium versions that record info from end and start of run text files





run_add_variables.py: goes over all runs to fill table APEXrunlist with various parameters taken from logfiles - runs apex_add_variables.py script

apex_add_variables.py: contains functions

		       APEX_get_end: gathers values form logfiles
