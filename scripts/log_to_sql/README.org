Basic structure of files:





Directories.py: contains names of local directories (different for jlab systems)


					
run_end_parse.py: goes over all runs to fill table APEXrunlist with various parameters taken from logfiles - runs apex_add_variables.py script
    - Uses apex_parse_end.py
      - beam energy, current, arm angles and momenta etc
      - apex_parse_end.py: contains functions 
	- APEX_get_end:  which returns a query and values for mysql
	- APEX_mysql: which inserts the results from APEX_get_end into the APEXRunlist
	  - Reads in variable mySQL and halog/EPICs names from Variables.csv
	    - variables need to be in specific format in log file (on their own line)


			   
run_end_parse_complex.py: should go over all runs to fill table APEXrunlist (and linked table HV_Values)
    - Uses apex_parse_end_complex.py
    - similar in principal to above scripts (run_end_parse.py and apex_parse_end.py) except that it parses through variables that are slightly more complicated to exract from end of run logfile
      - fills in run, target_type, prescale factor and other variables (for mysql table)
      - apex_parse_end.py: contains functions 
	- APEX_get_end:  which returns a query and values for mysql and equivalents of the HVs
	- APEX_mysql: which inserts the results from APEX_get_end into the APEXRunlist and HV_Result
